    <p>
      A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)

      <b>lexical environment</b>
      A lexical environment in JavaScript is a data structure that stores the
      variables and functions that are defined in the current scope and all of
      the outer scopes
